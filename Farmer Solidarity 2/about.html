  <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">History of farming in India: Where it all started</h2>

  <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; font-size: large; text-align: justify; overflow: scroll;">
    To know the farmer bills, we must know the history of farming sales and 
    the different stages of food production and distribution. In the beginning, 
    right after the independance act of 1947, farmers directly sold to the 
    consumers. But this system caused the farmers to go into debt, due to 
    other payments needed to be made such as rent and others. This made the 
    farmers have to go to money-lenders who bought their produce at a 
    substantially low price. To balance their loss, farmers had to take huge 
    loans that they weren't able to pay back. To help the farmers, the government 
    brought the APMC act, or the Agricultral Produce Market Commitee act. 
    The APMC act stated that no farmer can directly sell produce to a consumer, 
    and that all sales must take place in a mandi ([farmer] market). Mandis are 
    located in divided up areas across states, and are mandotory by law. For a 
    trader to buy from a mandi, they need to have a license. The produce is 
    then auctioned off in two different ways, the first using the MSP or 
    minimun support price. This is a fixed rate that is used as the minimum bid 
    for the auction. The other system is price discovery, this is simply the 
    price based on supply and demand. After the farmer has sold their product, 
    it passes through a chain of middle-men until it reaches the consumer. 
    Ultimately the farmer gets only about 15% of what the consumer bought it for. 
    </p>
<br><br>
    <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; font-size: large; text-align: justify; overflow: scroll;">
      The APMC act was first made to help the farmers from losing money, but rather 
      it made it worse as the years passed. This is because the APMC act introduced 
      MSP, and though it restricted buying from farmers at ridiculously low prices, 
      it gave an oppurtunity to traders to force farmers to sell to them at the lowest 
      price the MSP allowed them to go. Since farmers didn't have a choice on selling 
      their products, they had to sell it at a very low price that couldn't feed them or 
      their families, forcing them to borrow money again falling into an almost 
      unleaveable cycle.</p>

<h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">What are the Farmer Bills?</h2>

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; font-size: large; text-align: justify; overflow: scroll;">
 Now that you know a brief history of the farmer laws in India and how their sales 
 work, we can understand how the new bills imposed by the Modi government 
 are anti-farmer. The main idea of the laws are to remove the MSP and mandis, 
 removing the mandis means no market for the farmer to auction their produce, 
 meaning farmers will have to sell it to whoever comes to them. The removal of 
 the MSP means that there isn't a starting price for selling and the produce 
 can be sold a very low costs. Removing both of these things together will 
 eventually lead to only a few big buyers, corporates. This is because, since 
 the mandis are removed, farmers can't go to the previous customers of the 
 auction, traders (middlemen) and even the government. This leaves only big 
 corporates to sell to, who have enough storage for the produce. These big 
 tycoons like Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, the richest businessmen of India, 
 will buy from farmers at extremely low prices. This can be backed up by another 
 law the government of India passed which states that farmers cannot legally 
 sue corporates. This clearly shows that the government knows the outcome of 
 their laws is a big profit for corporates.</p>

      <h3>One buyer left</h3>
      <p>The new bills removing mandis and the MSP, allow only one buyer for farmers, 
         corporates or businessmen. This can be confirmed by another law the government
         passed stating farmers can't take legal action against corporates specifically.

      <h3>No mandis, no life</h3>
      <p>Mandis, farmer markets, where farmers used to sell their produce on auction
         are being removed, said to give freedom to farmers and allow them to sell wherever
         they want. In reality this removal gives corporates easy access to cheap produce.

      <h3>Cheap Produce</h3>
      <p>In addition to removing mandis, the Indian government has removed 
         the MSP (Minimum Support Price). Meaning farmers' produce can be 
         bought for extremely low prices.

      <h3>The degradation of the APMC Act</h3>
      <p>The APMC act which was first made to help farmers escape
         middlemen, soon didn't fit in with the evolving system and
         made farmers more prone to middlemen who took most of the 
         money let alone allow the farmer to make any profit. But 
         while the new bills remove these issues, they make it 
         much worse for farmers, since they have to worry about
         selling their produce at an extremely low price, that
         they will barely be able to survive.
