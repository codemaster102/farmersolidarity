      <h2>Join local rallies</h2>
      <p>One way to show solidarity can be as simple as joining a local rally (probably led by punjabi/sikh communities or other in your area).
         If you can't find a local protest or rally nearby and you are willing to fight for the farmers in India and show your solidarity, 
         you can start your own rally. Just make sure that you are protesting in front of or near to a place that can actually solve the problem.
         These include the Indian consulate, your mp/mpp's offices (they can take the problem up to higher levels of the government who will then 
         be aware and will hopefully stand against this issue). <br><b>Note: make sure when attending or holding a rally, you follow covid rules
         in your area.</b>
         </b>
      </p>

    <h2>Send a letter to the government</h2>
    <p>This method is a bit different than the last one. For this method, you can either send a letter or start a petition for the government
       describing what the issue is, why you are standing against it and what the government can do to help (If you want more info, head to the
       about page and you can also do some more research on your own). If you are sending a letter, then try to send it as a group rather than
       as an individual if you can. If you are choosing the latter, a petition (which you can make on many different sites like change.org), make 
       sure to spread the word and once you get a good amount of signatures then you can send it to the government.
    </p>

<section>
  <h2>Use social media</h2>
  <p>One great way to spread awareness currently is by using social media. So make sure to use a tool that almost everyone has access to.
     Open up your different social media accounts and post about the issue and tell everybody how they can help. Make sure to link some 
     websites so that people can read and know what you're talking about. Remember one tweet can change the world. 
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tell your friends and family</h2>
  <p>One easier way to spread the word is by telling it to the people you see everyday. Make your family and all your friends aware
     that there's something going on that you and them can fix. The reason telling it to your friends and family is so vital is because
     they'll listen and they will soon understand and undoubtly be ready to fight against such oppression
