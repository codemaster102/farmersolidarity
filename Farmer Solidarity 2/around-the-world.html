  <h2>Solidarity Around the world</h2><br>
  <p>
    Though the main events are taking place in India, many NRIs (non-resident Indians) and other supporters are showing solidarity <br>
    by protesting, using social media, and other such methods. You can find out how to show solidarity even as an individual in a <br>
    different country by heading over to the How can you help page.
